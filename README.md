# spacejumper

Spacejumper is a platform jumping game built with HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. My goal was to simply learn the basics of game programming with JS, which I think I have achieved quite well. In addition to learning the basics on canvas and general functionalities required by almost any game (animations, collision detections etc...), I learned about rendering sprites, which make the game also visually much more pleasing.

*Huge thanks to Chris Courses on Youtube for providing great programming material as well as to CraftPix.net for the game assets*
