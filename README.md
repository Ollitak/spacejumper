# spacejumper

Spacejumper is a platform jumping game built with HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. My goal was to simply learn the basics of game programming with JS, which I think I have achieved quite well. In addition to learning the basics on canvas and general functionalities required by almost any game (animations, collision detections etc...), I learned about rendering sprites, which make the game also visually much more pleasing.

## Movement
'A' and 'D' to move left and right, respectively

'W' to jump

'S' to start game

'R' to pause and unpause
